# Zombie Fight!

SmallTimeBeachBandits: Yanting Cheung & Jacob Westerback & Conner Westover

## The Game
Try to kill as many enemies as you can before you die! 
You have four weapons - pistol, machine gun, fire ball, and laser.
Pistols have infinite ammo but all the other ones have limited ammo.
But, do not fear, sometimes there are amo drops when you kill an enemy.
There are four kinds of pickups, red is for health, the others correspond to the color of each weapon's ammo.

Overall we accomplished what we set out to do with the exception of connecting to Facebook. We decided to upgrade our project to a newer version, but that messed up a lot of things and a lot of fixing was needed.
